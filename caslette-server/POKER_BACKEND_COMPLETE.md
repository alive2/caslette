- ✅ Action validation and processing
- ✅ Pot management and betting rounds
- ✅ Hand evaluation and winner determination

### 2. **Table Management**

- ✅ Create/join/leave tables
- ✅ Player seat management (up to 8 players)
- ✅ Observer functionality
- ✅ Table settings (blinds, buy-ins, time limits, etc.)
- ✅ Ready state management
- ✅ Auto-start and manual start options
- ✅ Private tables with password protection

### 3. **WebSocket Communication**

- ✅ Real-time message handling
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Room-based broadcasting for table updates
- ✅ Complete API for all poker operations
- ✅ Error handling and validation

### 4. **Game Actions API**

- ✅ `poker_action` - Perform poker actions (fold, call, raise, etc.)
- ✅ `get_game_state` - Get current game state
- ✅ `get_hand_history` - Get hand history
- ✅ `get_player_stats` - Get player statistics
- ✅ `join_table_room` - Join table for real-time updates

### 5. **Table Management API**

- ✅ `table_join` - Join as player or observer
- ✅ `table_leave` - Leave table
- ✅ `table_list` - List available tables
- ✅ `table_get` - Get table details
- ✅ `table_set_ready` - Set ready status
- ✅ `table_start_game` - Start game manually
- ✅ `table_close` - Close table
- ✅ `table_get_stats` - Get table statistics

### 6. **Real-time Events**

- ✅ Player join/leave broadcasts
- ✅ Game start/end events
- ✅ Poker action broadcasts
- ✅ Game state updates
- ✅ Ready status changes
- ✅ Table closure notifications

### 7. **Security & Validation**

- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Action validation (turn order, valid moves, etc.)
- ✅ Permission checking (table creator privileges)
- ✅ Rate limiting for table creation
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection

### 8. **Integration & Testing**

- ✅ Complete integration with existing WebSocket system
- ✅ Validation script confirms all components work
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`poker_integration_test.go`)
- ✅ Documentation with full API specification
- ✅ Ready-to-run server (`main_with_poker.go`)

## 🎯 Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
# Build the server
go build -o poker_server main_with_poker.go

# Run the server
./poker_server

# Or run directly
go run main_with_poker.go
```

### Validation

```bash
# Run basic validation
go run validate_poker_backend.go

# Run comprehensive tests
go test -v ./poker_integration_test.go
```

### WebSocket Connection

```
ws://localhost:8081/ws
```

## 📡 API Quick Reference

### Authentication

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "request_id": "req1",
  "data": { "token": "jwt_token" }
}
```

### Create Table

```json
{
  "type": "table_create",
  "request_id": "req2",
  "data": {
    "name": "My Table",
    "game_type": "texas_holdem",
    "settings": { "small_blind": 10, "big_blind": 20 }
  }
}
```

### Join Table

```json
{
  "type": "table_join",
  "request_id": "req3",
  "data": { "table_id": "table_uuid", "mode": "player" }
}
```

### Poker Action

```json
{
  "type": "poker_action",
  "request_id": "req4",
  "data": { "table_id": "table_uuid", "action": "raise", "amount": 50 }
}
```

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Connect & Authenticate** with JWT token
2. **Create or join table** with desired settings
3. **Set ready status** when prepared to play
4. **Game starts** automatically or manually
5. **Receive game state** with cards, pot, positions
6. **Perform actions** when it's your turn
7. **Receive real-time updates** from other players
8. **Game completes** and returns to waiting state

## 🔄 Real-time Events

The system broadcasts these events to all table participants:

- Player joins/leaves
- Game starts/ends
- Poker actions (fold, call, raise, etc.)
- Card dealing (flop, turn, river)
- Pot updates
- Winner announcements

## ✅ Testing Results

**Validation Script**: ✅ PASSED

- Texas Hold'em Engine: WORKING
- Game Actions: WORKING
- Table Management: WORKING
- WebSocket Handlers: WORKING

**Build Status**: ✅ COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY

- All dependencies resolved
- No compilation errors
- Ready for deployment

## 🏁 Next Steps for Frontend

The backend is **100% complete and ready**. Frontend team can now:

1. **Connect to WebSocket** at `ws://localhost:8081/ws`
2. **Implement authentication** using existing JWT tokens
3. **Build table lobby** using `table_list` and `table_create`
4. **Create game UI** using `get_game_state` and poker actions
5. **Handle real-time updates** from broadcasted events
6. **Add observer mode** for spectating games
7. **Display hand history** and player statistics

## 📋 API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available in:

- **`POKER_API.md`** - Full WebSocket API specification
